Hi there! I'm Flat.

I currently work on the [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/Tachiyomi) projects.

Right now I'm interested in learning 3D modeling with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to create my own chracters.

In the future I plan to write a GUI that looks similar to YouTube's web player for [MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) (Perhaps once it is migrated to Rust)
